## Overview

I recently finished my MSc in Data Science at Heriot-Watt University. Being an international student, I was keen to connect with the vibrant city of Edinburgh on a deeper level. To achieve this, I undertook a data engineering project that explores the vast amount of information available on the r/Edinburgh subreddit using the Reddit API. This project not only provides an exciting opportunity to apply my data engineering skills but also offers a unique perspective on the pulse of the local community and gives me insights into the current happenings around me.
